Deadlock and livelock are both undesirable situations in concurrent computing, but they represent different types of problems.

**Deadlock:**
- **Definition:** A deadlock is a state where two or more processes are blocked because each is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.
- **Characteristics:** In a deadlock, the processes are essentially stuck and cannot proceed. Each process is waiting for a resource that is held by another process, creating a circular waiting condition.
- **Resolution:** Deadlocks can be resolved by breaking one of the Coffman conditions, such as by introducing preemption, ensuring that resources are allocated in a way that avoids circular waiting, or using deadlock detection and recovery mechanisms.

**Livelock:**
- **Definition:** A livelock is a situation where two or more processes continuously change their state in response to the actions of the other processes, but no progress is made. It's a state of constant activity without reaching a resolution.
- **Characteristics:** In a livelock, processes are not blocked, and they are actively trying to resolve a conflict. However, the conflict resolution attempts are ineffective, and the processes remain in a loop of repeated actions, unable to make progress.
- **Resolution:** Livelocks can be more challenging to resolve than deadlocks. Strategies to address livelocks may involve introducing randomness into decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in resource allocation, or using timeout mechanisms to prevent infinite loops.

**Key Differences:**
1. **State of Processes:**
   - In a deadlock, processes are blocked and cannot make progress.
   - In a livelock, processes are not blocked but are stuck in a cycle of ineffective actions, making no progress.

2. **Cause:**
   - Deadlocks are caused by circular waiting and a set of specific conditions being met (Mutex, Hold and Wait, No Preemption, Circular Wait).
   - Livelocks are caused by conflicts or competing processes repeatedly taking actions in response to each other, resulting in a situation where no progress is made.

3. **Nature of Resolution:**
   - Deadlocks can often be resolved by breaking one of the Coffman conditions or using deadlock detection and recovery mechanisms.
   - Livelocks may require more sophisticated resolution strategies, such as introducing randomness or fairness to break the cycle of ineffective actions.

4. **Visibility:**
   - Deadlocks are typically easier to detect because processes are in a blocked state.
   - Livelocks may be more challenging to detect as processes are actively executing but not making progress.

In summary, deadlocks and livelocks both represent undesirable scenarios in concurrent systems, but they differ in terms of the state of processes, the cause of the problem, the nature of resolution, and the visibility of the issue. Addressing each requires careful consideration and application of specific strategies to restore normal operation.
