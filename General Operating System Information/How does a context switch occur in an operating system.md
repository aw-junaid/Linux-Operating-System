A **context switch** in an operating system is the process of saving the state of a currently running process (context) so that it can be restored later, and then loading the saved state of another process to allow it to run. Context switches are a fundamental operation in multitasking environments, enabling the system to efficiently share the CPU among multiple processes. The steps involved in a context switch are as follows:

1. **Saving the Current Context:**
   - The operating system interrupts the currently running process and saves its context, which includes the values of CPU registers, program counter, and other relevant information. This step ensures that the state of the process is preserved and can be restored later.

2. **Storing the Process State:**
   - The saved context is stored in the process control block (PCB) or a similar data structure associated with the currently running process. The PCB contains information about the process, including its state, priority, and the location in memory where its program code and data are stored.

3. **Selecting a New Process:**
   - The operating system scheduler determines which process to run next. This decision can be based on various factors such as process priority, time-sharing algorithms, or real-time requirements.

4. **Loading the New Context:**
   - The operating system loads the context of the selected process from its PCB. This involves updating the CPU registers, program counter, and other relevant information with the saved values associated with the new process.

5. **Resuming Execution:**
   - The CPU resumes execution from the point where the selected process was last interrupted. The new process now becomes the currently running process.

The context switch allows multiple processes to share the CPU, giving the illusion of concurrent execution. This interleaved execution is achieved by rapidly switching between processes. The frequency of context switches depends on the scheduling policy, time-sharing requirements, and the number of processes competing for CPU time.

Context switches incur a certain amount of overhead due to the need to save and restore the process state. Minimizing this overhead is crucial for maintaining system performance. Techniques such as efficient scheduling algorithms, optimized data structures (e.g., PCBs), and hardware support (e.g., context switch instructions in some processors) contribute to reducing context switch overhead.

In summary, a context switch involves saving the state of the currently running process, loading the saved state of another process, and resuming execution from where the new process left off. This mechanism enables multitasking and allows the operating system to efficiently manage and switch between multiple processes.
