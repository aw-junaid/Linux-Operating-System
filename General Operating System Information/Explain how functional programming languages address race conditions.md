**Functional programming (FP) languages address race conditions through a combination of inherent design principles and language features that minimize shared mutable state and emphasize immutability and controlled side effects:**

**1. Immutability by Default:**

- **Immutable Data Structures:** Most data structures in FP languages are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. This eliminates a major source of race conditions, as multiple threads can safely access and share immutable data without explicit synchronization.
- **New Instances for Updates:** Instead of modifying existing data, new instances are created with the desired changes, ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts.

**2. Pure Functions:**

- **No Side Effects:** FP emphasizes pure functions, which have no side effects (i.e., they don't modify external state or cause observable changes outside their scope). This further reduces the potential for race conditions, as pure functions can be safely executed concurrently without worrying about unintended interactions.

**3. Controlled State Handling:**

- **Explicit State Management:** When state is necessary, FP languages provide mechanisms to manage it in a controlled and explicit manner, often using techniques like:
    - **Reference Cells:** These allow for explicit updates to shared mutable state while still enforcing thread safety through controlled access.
    - **Actors:** The actor model encapsulates mutable state within actors that communicate via message passing, ensuring thread safety and isolation.
    - **Transactional Memory:** This approach allows multiple threads to propose changes to shared state, automatically resolving conflicts and ensuring consistency.

**4. Referential Transparency:**

- **Predictable Execution:** Pure functions and immutable data lead to referential transparency, meaning expressions can be replaced with their values without affecting program behavior. This makes reasoning about concurrent code easier and reduces the likelihood of unexpected race conditions.

**5. Language-Specific Features:**

- **Built-in Synchronization:** Some FP languages offer built-in synchronization mechanisms, such as:
    - **Software Transactional Memory (STM):** Supports atomic transactions for coordinating updates to shared state, reducing the need for manual locking.
    - **Dataflow Programming:** Enforces data dependencies to ensure operations execute in the correct order, avoiding race conditions.

**6. Alternative Concurrency Models:**

- **Message Passing:** FP languages often favor message passing over shared memory for concurrency, reducing the potential for race conditions by isolating state within actors or processes.

**7. Focus on Composition:**

- **Composable Functions:** FP encourages building complex systems by composing smaller, independent functions, which are easier to reason about and less prone to race conditions.

**In Conclusion:**

While not completely immune to race conditions, FP languages provide a strong foundation for building concurrent systems with a lower risk of such issues. By embracing immutability, pure functions, controlled state, and language-specific features, developers can create more robust and predictable concurrent applications.
