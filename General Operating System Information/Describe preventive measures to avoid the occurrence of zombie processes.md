To prevent the occurrence of zombie processes in UNIX-based systems, it's crucial to implement proper coding practices and adopt preventive measures. Here are some recommendations:

1. **Reap Child Processes in Parent Code:**
   - In the code of the parent process, make sure to include calls to `wait()` or `waitpid()` to collect the exit status of child processes. This ensures that the operating system cleans up the resources associated with terminated child processes.

   ```c
   #include <sys/wait.h>
   // ...
   pid_t child_pid = fork();
   if (child_pid == 0) {
       // Code for the child process
       // ...
   } else if (child_pid > 0) {
       // Code for the parent process
       waitpid(child_pid, NULL, 0);  // Wait for the child process
   }
   ```

2. **Signal Handling:**
   - Implement signal handling in the parent process to capture the termination signals sent by child processes. The `SIGCHLD` signal is specifically used to notify the parent about child process termination.

   ```c
   #include <signal.h>
   // ...
   signal(SIGCHLD, SIG_IGN);  // Ignore the SIGCHLD signal
   ```

   - Alternatively, set up a signal handler to handle the `SIGCHLD` signal and call `wait()` or `waitpid()` within the signal handler.

3. **Avoid Using `exit()` in Forked Code:**
   - If the child process uses `exit()` to terminate, it might leave a zombie process if the parent process does not handle it appropriately. Consider using `_exit()` or `return` instead.

4. **Periodic Cleanup in Daemon Processes:**
   - For daemon processes that run continuously, implement periodic cleanup routines to check for and collect exit statuses of terminated child processes.

5. **Close Unused File Descriptors:**
   - Ensure that all file descriptors not needed by the child process are closed. This can prevent issues related to file descriptor leaks that might contribute to zombie processes.

6. **Use Double Forking:**
   - In some scenarios, a double forking technique can be employed. This involves forking twice, and the grandchild process becomes detached from the original parent. The intermediate child process exits, leaving the grandchild as an orphan. The init process then becomes the parent of the grandchild, preventing the creation of zombie processes.

   ```c
   pid_t child_pid = fork();
   if (child_pid == 0) {
       pid_t grandchild_pid = fork();
       if (grandchild_pid == 0) {
           // Code for the grandchild process
           // ...
       }
       exit(0);  // Exit intermediate child process
   }
   ```

7. **Handle Errors Gracefully:**
   - Implement error-checking mechanisms in the code to handle errors gracefully. Unexpected errors in child processes might lead to abnormal termination and the creation of zombie processes.

8. **Update and Patch Applications:**
   - Regularly update and patch applications to address any known bugs or issues that could lead to the creation of zombie processes.

By incorporating these preventive measures into the design and coding practices of applications, developers can minimize the likelihood of zombie processes occurring in UNIX-based systems. Ensuring proper process management and cleanup contributes to the overall stability and efficiency of the system.
