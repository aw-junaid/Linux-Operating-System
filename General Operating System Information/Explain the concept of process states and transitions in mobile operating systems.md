In mobile operating systems, as well as in general operating systems, the concept of **process states** refers to the various stages that a process goes through during its lifetime. A process represents a running program, and its execution involves transitioning through different states. The common process states include:

1. **New:**
   - The process is in the "new" state when it is initially created. At this stage, the operating system is setting up the necessary data structures and resources for the process.

2. **Ready:**
   - In the "ready" state, the process is loaded into main memory and is waiting to be executed. It is eligible to run, but the CPU scheduler has not yet selected it for execution.

3. **Running:**
   - The process is in the "running" state when the CPU scheduler has selected it to execute. During this state, the process is actively using the CPU to perform its tasks.

4. **Blocked (or Waiting):**
   - A process enters the "blocked" state when it cannot proceed further until a specific event occurs. This event could be, for example, waiting for user input, waiting for data from I/O devices, or waiting for another process to complete.

5. **Terminated:**
   - The "terminated" state represents the end of a process's execution. It occurs when the process has completed its tasks or has been explicitly terminated by the operating system.

These process states form the basis for understanding the life cycle of a process. The transitions between these states are influenced by various events, actions, and the operating system scheduler. Here are the typical transitions:

1. **Creation:**
   - A new process is created, moving from the "new" state to the "ready" state. This transition involves setting up the process's data structures and allocating necessary resources.

2. **Dispatch:**
   - The process is moved from the "ready" state to the "running" state by the CPU scheduler. It now actively executes its instructions using the CPU.

3. **Preemption:**
   - A running process may be preempted by the CPU scheduler, transitioning it from the "running" state back to the "ready" state. Preemption occurs when a higher-priority process is scheduled to run or when the time quantum of the running process expires.

4. **Blocking:**
   - A running process may enter the "blocked" state if it encounters an event that requires it to wait, such as waiting for data from a disk or user input. The process is then moved from the "running" state to the "blocked" state.

5. **Unblocking (or Wake-Up):**
   - When the event for which the process was waiting occurs, the process transitions from the "blocked" state to the "ready" state. It is now eligible to be scheduled for execution.

6. **Completion:**
   - When a process finishes its execution, it moves from the "running" state to the "terminated" state. Resources associated with the process are deallocated, and the process is removed from the system.

These state transitions are orchestrated by the operating system's process scheduler, which determines when to switch between processes based on scheduling algorithms, priorities, and events. Efficient process scheduling is crucial for optimizing system performance and ensuring fairness among competing processes in a mobile operating system.
