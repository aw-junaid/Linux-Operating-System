 **Here are the goals and criteria considered when designing an effective CPU scheduling algorithm:**

**Primary Goals:**

- **Maximize CPU utilization:** Ensure the CPU is kept as busy as possible to maximize system throughput and avoid idle time.
- **Minimize response time:** Reduce the time it takes for a process to start responding after a request is made. This is crucial for interactive systems where users expect prompt responses.
- **Minimize turnaround time:** Reduce the total time it takes for a process to complete from submission to termination. This improves overall system efficiency and user experience.
- **Maintain fairness:** Ensure that all processes get a reasonable share of CPU time, preventing starvation or indefinite waiting. This is important for ensuring system responsiveness and preventing any process from being unfairly disadvantaged.

**Additional Criteria:**

- **Priority:** Support processes with different priorities, allowing more important tasks to be executed first. This is essential for systems with diverse workloads and critical tasks.
- **Predictability:** Provide predictable response times and completion times, especially for real-time systems with strict timing requirements.
- **Overhead:** Minimize the overhead associated with context switching (saving and restoring CPU state when switching processes). This is crucial for maintaining good performance.
- **Scalability:** Adapt to multi-core and multi-processor systems to effectively utilize available hardware resources.
- **Thrashing avoidance:** Prevent thrashing, a situation where excessive context switching degrades performance due to high I/O wait times.
- **Batch vs. interactive processes:** Balance the needs of batch processes (long-running, non-interactive) and interactive processes (short, user-driven) effectively.
- **Real-time requirements:** Meet deadlines for real-time processes in systems with strict timing constraints.
- **Power management:** Optimize CPU usage for energy efficiency, especially in mobile or battery-powered devices.

**Trade-offs:**

- It's often impossible to optimize all criteria simultaneously. Scheduling algorithms must balance different goals based on system requirements and workload characteristics.
- The choice of the most suitable algorithm depends on these priorities and the specific use cases of the system.

**Effective scheduling algorithms carefully balance these goals and criteria to achieve the desired system performance, responsiveness, fairness, and predictability.**
