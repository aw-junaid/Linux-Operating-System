A **zombie process** is a concept in operating systems that refers to a process that has completed its execution but still has an entry in the process table. In other words, a zombie process is a terminated process that has not yet been completely removed from the system.

When a process terminates, it usually sends a termination status to its parent process. The parent process is then responsible for collecting this exit status using a system call such as `wait()`. Once the parent retrieves the exit status of the terminated child process, the operating system can reclaim the resources associated with that process.

However, in the case of a zombie process, the parent process fails to collect the exit status of the terminated child process. As a result, the terminated process remains in the process table with a status of "zombie." The zombie process retains its process ID (PID) and consumes system resources, such as an entry in the process table and a small amount of memory.

Zombie processes are generally harmless in small numbers, but if a large number of processes become zombies and the parent processes do not clean them up, it can lead to a gradual depletion of system resources. In well-designed programs, parent processes typically handle the termination status of their children, preventing the creation of zombie processes.

To address zombie processes, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Parent Process Handling:**
   - Ensure that the parent processes collect the exit status of their terminated children using system calls like `wait()` or `waitpid()`.

2. **Reaping Zombie Processes:**
   - If a parent process does not collect the exit status of a terminated child, the operating system may eventually reap the zombie process and reclaim its resources.

3. **Terminating Orphaned Processes:**
   - In some cases, if a parent process terminates before its child, the child may become orphaned. In such situations, the child process might be adopted by the init process, which ensures that its exit status is collected.

Zombie processes are a normal part of the process life cycle, but they should be temporary. If a system has a large number of persistent zombie processes, it may indicate a problem with the parent processes not handling the termination of their children appropriately. Regular monitoring and proper handling of process termination in the code can help prevent the accumulation of zombie processes in an operating system.
