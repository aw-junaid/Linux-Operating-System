Functional programming languages approach concurrency and process synchronization in a distinctive way compared to imperative languages. Functional languages emphasize immutability, referential transparency, and the avoidance of side effects, which impacts how concurrency and synchronization are handled. Key features and approaches in functional languages include:

1. **Immutable Data:**
   - Functional languages encourage the use of immutable data structures, where once a data structure is created, it cannot be modified. This eliminates the need for locks or other synchronization mechanisms to protect shared mutable state. Instead, new copies of data structures are created when modifications are needed.

2. **Immutable Variables:**
   - In addition to immutable data structures, functional languages often promote the use of immutable variables. Variables, once assigned a value, do not change. This contributes to thread safety and eliminates the need for locks to protect shared mutable variables.

3. **Pure Functions:**
   - Pure functions in functional languages do not have side effects and produce the same output for the same input every time they are called. Pure functions make it easier to reason about code and enable parallelism without concerns about shared state modification.

4. **Concurrency through Immutability:**
   - Functional languages leverage immutability to achieve concurrency. Multiple threads or processes can operate on independent, immutable data structures without the risk of data corruption. This supports parallelism without the need for explicit synchronization.

5. **Functional Abstractions:**
   - Functional languages provide high-level abstractions for concurrent programming. Features like higher-order functions, map/reduce, and monads can be used to express concurrent and parallel computations in a concise and expressive manner.

6. **Concurrency Models:**
   - Functional languages often adopt specific concurrency models, such as the Actor model or Software Transactional Memory (STM).
      - **Actor Model:** Actors are independent entities that communicate by passing messages. Each actor has its own state and can process messages concurrently. Erlang is an example of a functional language that embraces the Actor model.
      - **STM:** Software Transactional Memory allows multiple transactions to occur concurrently, with the ability to roll back changes in case of conflicts. Haskell, for example, supports STM for managing shared state.

7. **Immutable Message Passing:**
   - Communication between concurrent entities is often achieved through immutable message passing. Message-passing concurrency models, like those based on the Actor model, allow threads or processes to communicate by sending immutable messages, avoiding shared mutable state.

8. **Parallelism with Higher-Order Functions:**
   - Higher-order functions, such as `map` and `reduce`, can be parallelized effortlessly in functional languages. Operations on lists or collections can be distributed across multiple processors or cores without explicit synchronization, as the absence of mutable state reduces the risk of race conditions.

9. **Lazy Evaluation:**
   - Some functional languages feature lazy evaluation, where expressions are evaluated only when their values are needed. Lazy evaluation can be advantageous in certain concurrent scenarios, allowing for more efficient use of resources.

In summary, functional languages approach concurrency and process synchronization by leveraging immutability, pure functions, and high-level abstractions that minimize the need for explicit locks and mutable shared state. This approach facilitates reasoning about concurrent programs and can lead to more scalable and maintainable code in parallel and distributed systems.
