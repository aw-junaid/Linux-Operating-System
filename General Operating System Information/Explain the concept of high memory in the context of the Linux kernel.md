In the context of the Linux kernel, the term "high memory" refers to a region of the virtual address space that is reserved for kernel-related activities but is not directly mapped into the kernel's address space. This concept is particularly relevant in systems with a large amount of physical memory.

Here are key points to understand about high memory in the Linux kernel:

1. **Address Space Splitting:**
   - In a 32-bit architecture, the virtual address space is typically divided into two main regions: user space and kernel space. The user space is used by user applications, while the kernel space is reserved for the Linux kernel.

2. **Kernel Space Limitations:**
   - In a 32-bit architecture, the kernel space is limited to a certain size, often 1 GB or 896 MB, depending on the kernel configuration. This limitation becomes a concern in systems with a significant amount of physical memory (RAM) because a large portion of the memory cannot be directly addressed within the kernel's space.

3. **Low Memory and High Memory:**
   - To address the limitations of the kernel space in handling large amounts of physical memory, the Linux kernel introduces the concepts of "low memory" and "high memory." The low memory region is the portion directly mapped into the kernel's address space, while the high memory region is not directly mapped.

4. **Direct Mapped and High Memory Mapped:**
   - The low memory region is directly mapped, meaning that each physical page has a corresponding virtual address within the kernel space. In contrast, the high memory region is not directly mapped, and access to high memory requires special handling.

5. **Page Tables and High Memory:**
   - Due to the limitations of the kernel's address space, accessing high memory involves the use of additional page tables. High memory pages are dynamically mapped into the kernel's virtual address space as needed, using temporary page tables.

6. **Kernel Swapping and High Memory:**
   - The concept of high memory is closely related to kernel swapping, a mechanism used when the physical memory is insufficient to hold all the required data. High memory pages are eligible for swapping, allowing the kernel to swap out less frequently used data to free up physical memory.

7. **Kernel Memory Allocator:**
   - The kernel memory allocator, whether it's SLAB, SLUB, or SLOB, is responsible for managing both low memory and high memory. The allocator determines where to allocate memory based on the size of the allocation and the available memory in both regions.

8. **64-Bit Architectures:**
   - On 64-bit architectures, the need for high memory is significantly reduced because the larger virtual address space allows the direct mapping of a vast amount of physical memory into the kernel space. High memory considerations are more relevant in the context of 32-bit architectures.

In summary, high memory in the Linux kernel is a concept introduced to address the limitations of the kernel's address space in systems with a large amount of physical memory. It involves dynamically mapping portions of physical memory into the kernel's address space when needed, with special handling and consideration for swapping and memory allocation. The introduction of 64-bit architectures has mitigated some of the concerns associated with high memory in modern systems.
