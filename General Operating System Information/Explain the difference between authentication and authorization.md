**Authentication** and **authorization** are distinct but closely related concepts in the field of computer security. Both are fundamental components of access control, ensuring that users or processes have the appropriate level of access to system resources. Here's an explanation of the key differences between authentication and authorization:

1. **Authentication:**
   - **Definition:** Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, process, or system component. It involves validating the credentials provided by an entity, such as a username and password, digital certificate, biometric data (fingerprint or facial recognition), or a combination of these factors.
   - **Objective:** The primary goal of authentication is to establish the identity of an entity attempting to access a system or resource. It ensures that the entity is who it claims to be.
   - **Outcome:** After successful authentication, the system issues an authentication token or grants a session, indicating that the entity is verified and allowed to interact with the system.

2. **Authorization:**
   - **Definition:** Authorization is the process of granting or denying access permissions and privileges to authenticated entities based on their identity and the security policies in place. It involves determining what actions or operations a user or process is allowed to perform.
   - **Objective:** The main goal of authorization is to control and manage the level of access that authenticated entities have to specific resources. It defines the boundaries of permissible actions and enforces security policies.
   - **Outcome:** Authorization results in the assignment of specific permissions or roles to an authenticated entity, specifying what actions it can take, what resources it can access, and what operations it can perform.

3. **Key Differences:**
   - **Focus:**
     - - **Authentication:** Focuses on verifying identity.
     - - **Authorization:** Focuses on determining access permissions.
   - **Timing:**
     - - **Authentication:** Occurs during the initial login or access attempt.
     - - **Authorization:** Occurs after authentication and involves determining what actions the authenticated entity is allowed to perform.
   - **Verification vs. Permission:**
     - - **Authentication:** Verifies who you are.
     - - **Authorization:** Determines what you are allowed to do.
   - **Example:**
     - - **Authentication:** Verifying a user's username and password during login.
     - - **Authorization:** Granting a user read-only or read-write access to a specific file or directory after successful login.

4. **Relationship:**
   - - Authentication and authorization work together in the access control process. Authentication precedes authorization, as a user or process must first prove its identity before being granted or denied access based on authorization rules.
   - - Authentication provides the foundation for authorization decisions. Once an entity is authenticated, the system can determine the appropriate level of access it should have based on its identity and assigned roles or permissions.

In summary, authentication and authorization serve complementary roles in access control. Authentication verifies the identity of an entity, while authorization determines what actions and resources that authenticated entity is allowed to access. Both are crucial components of a robust security framework, working together to protect against unauthorized access and ensure the proper use of system resources.
