A **page fault** is an interrupt that occurs when a program or process attempts to access data or code that is not currently in the computer's main memory (RAM) but is marked as being in its logical address space. When the memory management unit (MMU) encounters a page fault, it signals the operating system that a required page is not present in RAM and needs to be brought in from secondary storage (usually the hard disk or SSD). Page faults are a normal part of virtual memory systems and are managed by the operating system to ensure that processes can access the data they need.

The process of handling a page fault typically involves the following steps:

1. **Page Table Lookup:**
   - When a process attempts to access a specific memory location, the MMU consults the page table to determine whether the corresponding page is in RAM.

2. **Page Not Present:**
   - If the page table indicates that the required page is not present in RAM (marked as "not present" or "invalid"), a page fault is triggered.

3. **Operating System Intervention:**
   - The operating system is notified of the page fault, and the control is transferred to the appropriate page fault handler.

4. **Page Replacement or Fetching:**
   - The operating system decides whether to replace an existing page in RAM with the required page or to fetch the missing page from secondary storage into an available page frame in RAM.

5. **Update Page Table:**
   - Once the missing page is loaded into RAM, the page table is updated to reflect the new location of the page as "present" or "valid."

6. **Resume Execution:**
   - The instruction that caused the page fault is re-executed, and this time, the MMU can successfully find the required page in RAM.

Page faults can occur for various reasons, including:

- **Demand Paging:** In demand paging systems, not all pages of a process are loaded into memory initially. Pages are brought into memory only when they are accessed, leading to page faults for initially unloaded pages.

- **Page Swapping:** When the operating system decides to swap out a page to make space for another page, a page fault occurs when the swapped-out page is accessed again.

- **Copy-on-Write:** In systems that use copy-on-write mechanisms, a page fault may occur when a process attempts to modify a page marked as read-only, resulting in a copy of the page being made for the modifying process.

Handling page faults efficiently is crucial for the performance of virtual memory systems. The operating system must strike a balance between keeping frequently accessed pages in RAM and using secondary storage effectively to minimize the impact of page faults on overall system performance.
