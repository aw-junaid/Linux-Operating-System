In Linux, there is no specific `uncompress` command. Instead, various compression utilities such as `gzip`, `bzip2`, and `xz` are used to compress and decompress files. To decompress a file, you typically use the corresponding utility with the appropriate command-line options.

Here's a table explaining how to decompress files using different compression utilities:

| Compression Utility | Command to Decompress     | Example                              |
|---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| gzip                | `gzip -d` or `gunzip`     | `gzip -d file.txt.gz`                |
| bzip2               | `bzip2 -d` or `bunzip2`   | `bzip2 -d file.txt.bz2`              |
| xz                  | `xz -d` or `unxz`         | `xz -d file.txt.xz`                  |
| zip                 | `unzip`                   | `unzip archive.zip`                  |
| compress (.Z)       | `uncompress`              | `uncompress file.txt.Z`              |

Please note that the `uncompress` command is specific to the `.Z` extension (compress utility) for compressing files. It is different from the general `uncompress` command, which is not available in Linux. For other compression utilities like `gzip`, `bzip2`, and `xz`, you need to use their respective decompression commands, as shown in the examples above.

Always check the available options and correct command usage by referring to the command's manual (`man` page) for more details. For example, `man gzip`, `man bzip2`, or `man xz`.
