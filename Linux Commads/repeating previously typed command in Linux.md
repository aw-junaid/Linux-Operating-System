In Linux, you can repeat previously typed commands using a few different methods. Here are two common ways to repeat commands:

1. Using the Up Arrow Key:
   By pressing the Up Arrow key, you can scroll through your command history and repeat previously typed commands. Each press of the Up Arrow key takes you back to the previous command in the history.

2. Using the `!!` Symbol:
   The `!!` symbol is a special notation that repeats the last command entered in the terminal.

Here's a table explaining the methods to repeat previously typed commands:

| Method         | Description                                                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Up Arrow Key   | Pressing the Up Arrow key scrolls through command history, allowing you to access previously typed commands. |
| `!!`           | Entering `!!` on the command line will repeat the last command that was entered.                              |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use these methods to repeat previously typed commands:

1. Using the Up Arrow Key:
   - Type a command, for example: `ls`.
   - Press the Up Arrow key to go back to the previous command (`ls` in this case).
   - Press the Up Arrow key again to go further back in the history.

2. Using the `!!` Symbol:
   - Suppose you have previously executed the command: `sudo apt update`.
   - To repeat the same command, type `!!` and press Enter:
     ```bash
     !!
     ```
   - This will execute `sudo apt update` again.

Using these methods, you can quickly repeat frequently used commands or re-execute commands without having to type them again from scratch. It's a convenient way to save time and streamline your workflow when working in the Linux terminal.
