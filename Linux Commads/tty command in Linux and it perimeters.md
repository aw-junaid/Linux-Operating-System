The `tty` command in Linux is used to print the file name of the terminal connected to the standard input. It displays the file name of the terminal associated with the current shell session, allowing users to identify the terminal they are using.

The basic syntax of the `tty` command is as follows:

```
tty [options]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `tty` command:

| Option       | Description                                              |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| --help       | Display help and exit.                                   |
| --version    | Output version information and exit.                     |

The `tty` command has no specific parameters. When executed without options, it simply prints the file name of the terminal associated with the current shell session.

Now, let's see an example of how to use the `tty` command:

```bash
tty
```

Running this command will display the file name of the terminal associated with the current shell session. For instance, it could output something like:

```
/dev/pts/0
```

The output will vary depending on the terminal you are using and the specific setup of your system. The `/dev/pts/X` format is common for pseudo-terminals, which are virtual terminals used in terminal emulators and SSH sessions.

The `tty` command is useful for confirming the terminal you are using, especially when working on remote systems through SSH or when using multiple terminal sessions. Knowing the terminal can help with troubleshooting or understanding the environment in which commands are executed.
