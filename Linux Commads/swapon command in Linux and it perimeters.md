The `swapon` command in Linux is used to activate or enable a swap area on a storage device. Swap space is an area on a disk used as virtual memory when the physical RAM (Random Access Memory) is fully utilized. The `swapon` command allows you to make the swap space available for use, which can help prevent system crashes due to out-of-memory situations.

The basic syntax of the `swapon` command is as follows:

```
swapon [options] device
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `swapon` command:

| Parameter/Option | Description                                                                                             |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| device           | Specifies the device (e.g., /dev/sda2) representing the swap area to be activated.                      |
| --priority=N     | Specifies the priority of the swap area. Lower values have higher priorities. Default is 0.            |
| --help           | Display help and exit.                                                                                |
| --version        | Output version information and exit.                                                                  |

The `--priority` option is used to set the priority of the swap area when multiple swap spaces are used. A higher priority means the swap area will be used more often compared to other swap areas with lower priorities.

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `swapon` command:

1. Activate the swap area on /dev/sda2:

```bash
sudo swapon /dev/sda2
```

This will activate the swap area located on the device `/dev/sda2`.

2. Activate the swap area with a specific priority:

```bash
sudo swapon --priority=10 /dev/sdb1
```

This will activate the swap area on `/dev/sdb1` with a priority of 10. If there are other swap areas, the priority helps determine the usage order.

3. Enable all defined swap areas listed in /etc/fstab:

```bash
sudo swapon -a
```

This will activate all defined swap areas listed in the `/etc/fstab` file during system startup.

4. Display current swap status:

```bash
sudo swapon --show
```

This will display a table showing the currently active swap devices along with their sizes and priorities.

To deactivate or disable a swap area, you can use the `swapoff` command followed by the device or partition representing the swap area:

```bash
sudo swapoff /dev/sda2
```

This will deactivate the swap area located on `/dev/sda2`.

Properly configuring and managing swap space is important for systems with limited physical RAM or in situations where memory-intensive processes may lead to memory exhaustion. The use of swap space can improve system stability by providing additional virtual memory when needed. However, excessive reliance on swap space may negatively impact performance since disk access is slower than accessing RAM.
