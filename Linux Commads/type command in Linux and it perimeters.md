In Linux, the `type` command is used to determine how a command or an alias will be interpreted by the shell. It helps you identify whether the command is a built-in shell command, an alias, a function, or an external binary (executable file).

The basic syntax of the `type` command is:

```
type <name>
```

Here is a table outlining the parameters of the `type` command:

| Parameter       | Description                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `<name>`        | Specifies the name of the command or alias you want to examine.|

Examples:

1. Determine the type of the `ls` command:
```
type ls
```

Sample output:
```
ls is aliased to `ls --color=auto'
```

2. Check the type of the `grep` command:
```
type grep
```

Sample output:
```
grep is /bin/grep
```

3. Identify the type of a custom alias `ll`:
```
type ll
```

Sample output:
```
ll is aliased to `ls -lh --color=auto'
```

4. Find out the type of the `cd` command:
```
type cd
```

Sample output:
```
cd is a shell builtin
```

5. Determine the type of a shell function (if it exists):
```
type my_function
```

Sample output (if it's a function):
```
my_function is a function
my_function ()
{
    echo "This is my custom function."
}
```

6. Check the type of a non-existent command:
```
type nonexistent_command
```

Sample output:
```
bash: type: nonexistent_command: not found
```

The `type` command is helpful for understanding how the shell will interpret a given command or alias, especially if you have multiple versions of a command installed or if you're unsure about the origin of an alias or function.
