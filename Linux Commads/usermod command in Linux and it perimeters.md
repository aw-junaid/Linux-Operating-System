The `usermod` command in Linux is used to modify existing user accounts. It allows system administrators to change various attributes of a user, such as the user ID (UID), group ID (GID), home directory, default shell, and more.

The basic syntax of the `usermod` command is as follows:

```
usermod [options] <username>
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `usermod` command:

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `usermod` command:

1. Change the default shell for a user:

```bash
sudo usermod -s /bin/bash john
```

This command will change the default shell for the user `john` to `/bin/bash`.

2. Change the home directory for a user:

```bash
sudo usermod -d /home/newhome alice
```

This command will change the home directory for the user `alice` to `/home/newhome`.

3. Add a user to additional groups:

```bash
sudo usermod -a -G developers,admins bob
```

This command will add the user `bob` to the `developers` and `admins` groups, in addition to their primary group.

4. Lock a user account:

```bash
sudo usermod -L smith
```

This command will lock the user account of `smith`, disabling login for that user.

5. Unlock a previously locked user account:

```bash
sudo usermod -U smith
```

This command will unlock the previously locked user account of `smith`, allowing the user to log in again.

Please note that modifying user accounts typically requires administrative privileges (using `sudo`) as it involves changes to system settings. Additionally, it's important to be cautious when making changes to user accounts to avoid unintentional errors or security issues.
