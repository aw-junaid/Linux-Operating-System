The `atrm` command in Linux is used to remove or delete `at` jobs from the queue. When you schedule tasks using the `at` command, they are added to a queue for later execution. The `atrm` command allows you to remove specific `at` jobs from the queue, preventing them from being executed at their scheduled time.

The basic syntax of the `atrm` command is as follows:

```
atrm <job_id>...
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameter of the `atrm` command:

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| job_id      | Specifies the job ID(s) of the `at` jobs to be removed. You can specify multiple job IDs.   |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `atrm` command:

1. Remove a single `at` job from the queue:

```bash
atrm 1
```

This command will remove the `at` job with ID 1 from the queue.

2. Remove multiple `at` jobs from the queue:

```bash
atrm 1 3 5
```

This command will remove the `at` jobs with IDs 1, 3, and 5 from the queue.

3. Remove all `at` jobs from the queue:

```bash
atrm $(atq | awk '{print $1}')
```

This command will remove all `at` jobs from the queue. The `atq` command lists all pending `at` jobs, and `awk` is used to extract the job IDs, which are then passed to `atrm` for removal.

Keep in mind that once you remove an `at` job from the queue using `atrm`, it cannot be undone, and the scheduled task will not be executed at its specified time. Be careful when using `atrm` to avoid accidentally deleting important tasks.
