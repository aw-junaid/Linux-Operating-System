In Linux, the `whatis` command is used to display a brief one-line description of a command or a topic from the system's manual pages (man pages). It provides a quick overview of what a particular command or topic does, helping users to get a basic understanding without opening the full manual page.

The basic syntax of the `whatis` command is:

```
whatis <command_or_topic>
```

Here is a table outlining the parameters of the `whatis` command:

| Parameter            | Description                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `<command_or_topic>` | Specifies the name of a command or a specific topic for which you want to see the brief description.|

Examples:

1. Display a brief description of the `ls` command:
```
whatis ls
```

Sample output:
```
ls (1) - list directory contents
```

2. Get a quick overview of the `grep` command:
```
whatis grep
```

Sample output:
```
grep (1) - print lines matching a pattern
```

3. Show a one-line description of the C `printf` function:
```
whatis printf
```

Sample output:
```
printf (3) - formatted output conversion
```

4. Check what `tar` does:
```
whatis tar
```

Sample output:
```
tar (1) - an archiving utility
```

5. Get a brief description of the `passwd` command:
```
whatis passwd
```

Sample output:
```
passwd (1) - change user password
```

The `whatis` command is a useful tool for quickly finding out the purpose of commands and topics, making it easier for users to identify the right command for their needs without having to browse the full manual page.
