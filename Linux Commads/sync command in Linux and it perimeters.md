The `sync` command in Linux is used to ensure that all pending disk writes are synchronized and flushed to the storage device. It ensures that data is written from the system's memory cache to the physical disk, minimizing the risk of data loss or corruption during system crashes or power failures.

The `sync` command has no specific parameters or options.

Here's a table with details about the `sync` command:

| Command       | Description                                                                                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| sync          | Flush pending disk writes to the storage device.                                                        |

Now, let's see an example of how to use the `sync` command:

```bash
sync
```

The `sync` command is typically used before shutting down or rebooting a Linux system. It helps ensure that any data in the system's memory cache is written to the disk, reducing the risk of data loss or file corruption. While modern systems automatically perform periodic syncing in the background, manually using `sync` before critical operations provides an extra layer of safety for valuable data.
