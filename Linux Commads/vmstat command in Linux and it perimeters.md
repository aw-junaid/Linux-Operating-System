The `vmstat` command in Linux is a powerful tool used to display virtual memory statistics. It provides information about various aspects of the system's virtual memory usage, including memory, process, CPU, and I/O statistics. The `vmstat` command is particularly useful for monitoring system performance and diagnosing performance-related issues.

The basic syntax of the `vmstat` command is as follows:

```
vmstat [options] [delay] [count]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `vmstat` command:

| Parameter/Option | Description                                                                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| delay            | Specifies the time interval (in seconds) between updates. If omitted, vmstat provides a single snapshot. |
| count            | Specifies the number of updates to be displayed at the given time interval.                             |
| -a               | Display active and inactive memory information.                                                         |
| -d               | Display disk statistics.                                                                                |
| -p               | Display partition statistics.                                                                           |
| -s               | Display memory usage summary.                                                                           |
| -t               | Display timestamp for each line.                                                                        |
| --help           | Display help and exit.                                                                                 |
| --version        | Output version information and exit.                                                                   |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `vmstat` command:

1. Display a single snapshot of virtual memory statistics:

```bash
vmstat
```

This will display a single snapshot of virtual memory statistics, including memory, process, CPU, and I/O information.

2. Display virtual memory statistics every 5 seconds for a total of 3 updates:

```bash
vmstat 5 3
```

This will display virtual memory statistics every 5 seconds with a total of 3 updates.

3. Display active and inactive memory information:

```bash
vmstat -a
```

This will display virtual memory statistics, including active and inactive memory.

4. Display disk statistics:

```bash
vmstat -d
```

This will display virtual memory statistics related to disk usage and I/O.

5. Display memory usage summary:

```bash
vmstat -s
```

This will display a summary of memory usage statistics.

6. Display timestamp for each line:

```bash
vmstat -t
```

This will display virtual memory statistics with a timestamp for each line.

The `vmstat` command is a versatile tool for analyzing virtual memory usage and system performance. By monitoring the output, system administrators can identify potential performance bottlenecks and take necessary actions to optimize system resources.
