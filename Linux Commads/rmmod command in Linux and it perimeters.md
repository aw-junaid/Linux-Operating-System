The `rmmod` command in Linux is used to remove or unload a kernel module from the running kernel. Kernel modules are small pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded or unloaded into the kernel to add or extend its functionality without the need to reboot the system.

The basic syntax of the `rmmod` command is as follows:

```
rmmod <module_name>
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameter of the `rmmod` command:

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| module_name | Specifies the name of the kernel module to be removed or unloaded from the running kernel.  |

Now, let's see an example of how to use the `rmmod` command:

Suppose we have a kernel module named `my_module`. To remove or unload the module, we can use the following command:

```bash
sudo rmmod my_module
```

This command will remove or unload the `my_module` kernel module from the running kernel.

Before removing a kernel module, it's essential to ensure that the module is not being used by any processes or other modules. If the module is in use, the `rmmod` command will fail, and you'll need to unload any dependent modules or stop processes using the module before removing it.

Additionally, some distributions might use `modprobe -r` instead of `rmmod` for removing modules, as `modprobe` automatically handles module dependencies and cleanup.
