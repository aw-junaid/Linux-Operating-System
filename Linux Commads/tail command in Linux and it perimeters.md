The `tail` command in Linux is used to display the last few lines of a file. It is especially useful when you want to monitor log files, view the end of large files, or observe real-time updates in a continuously growing file. The `tail` command allows you to quickly check the most recent entries in a file without loading the entire file into memory.

The basic syntax of the `tail` command is as follows:

```
tail [options] [file]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `tail` command:

| Parameter/Option | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| file             | Specifies the name of the file to display the last lines from. If not provided, `tail` reads from standard input.   |
| -n, --lines=NUM  | Display the last NUM lines of the file (default is 10).  |
| -f, --follow     | Output appended data as the file grows (similar to `tail -f` or "follow mode"). The command will not exit and will keep updating the display as new data is added to the file. |
| -c, --bytes=NUM  | Display the last NUM bytes instead of lines.            |
| -q, --quiet      | Never output headers giving file names.                 |
| --max-unchanged-stats=N | With `-f`, terminate after N seconds of inactivity.   |
| --pid=PID        | With `-f`, terminate after process with PID dies.       |
| --retry          | With `-f`, keep trying to open a file even when it's inaccessible or renamed. |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `tail` command:

1. Display the last 10 lines of a file:

```bash
tail file.txt
```

This will print the last 10 lines of `file.txt`.

2. Display the last 20 lines of a file:

```bash
tail -n 20 file.txt
```

This will print the last 20 lines of `file.txt`.

3. Display the last 100 bytes of a file:

```bash
tail -c 100 file.txt
```

This will print the last 100 bytes of `file.txt`.

4. Display the last 10 lines of a file and keep updating as new data is added:

```bash
tail -f file.txt
```

This will display the last 10 lines of `file.txt` and continuously update the output as new lines are appended to the file.

5. Display the last 5 lines of multiple files:

```bash
tail -n 5 file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

This will print the last 5 lines of each file (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`) one after another.

The `tail` command is a handy tool for monitoring and examining the most recent contents of files, especially log files that are constantly being updated with new information.
