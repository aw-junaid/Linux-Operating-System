The `less` command in Linux is used to view the contents of a file one screenful at a time. It allows you to scroll through the file, search for specific text, and navigate easily. `less` is a more advanced and user-friendly alternative to the traditional `more` command, providing additional features like backward scrolling and searching.

The basic syntax of the `less` command is:

```
less [options] file
```

Where:
- `file` is the name of the file you want to view using `less`.

Here's a table showing some common options of the `less` command:

| Option         | Description                                                                                      |

Examples:

1. View the contents of a file using `less`:
   ```
   less filename.txt
   ```
   This command will open `filename.txt` in `less`, allowing you to navigate through the file using the arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, and other keys.

2. Display line numbers while viewing the file:
   ```
   less -N large_file.log
   ```
   This command will open `large_file.log` in `less` with line numbers displayed on the left side of the screen.

3. Search for a specific pattern in the file:
   ```
   less myfile.txt
   ```
   Press `/` and then type the pattern you want to search for. Press Enter to find the first occurrence, and use `n` to find the next occurrence.

4. Ignore case while searching for a pattern:
   ```
   less -i data.txt
   ```
   This command will open `data.txt` in `less`, and search for patterns will be case-insensitive.

5. Display the help screen for `less`:
   ```
   less --help
   ```
   This command will provide detailed information on the various options available with the `less` command.

6. Quit `less`:
   ```
   less large_file.log
   ```
   Press `q` or `Q` to quit `less` and return to the terminal.

The `less` command is a useful tool for viewing and analyzing the contents of large files, especially log files, configuration files, and other text-based documents. Its ability to scroll, search, and navigate easily makes it an essential command-line utility for reading text files in Linux.
