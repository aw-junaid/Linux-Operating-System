The `dpkg` command in Linux is used to manage Debian package files (.deb). It allows users to install, remove, and query information about packages on Debian-based systems, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and their derivatives. The `dpkg` command works at a lower level than package managers like `apt`, and it directly interacts with the package management system.

Here's a table explaining some of the main parameters and options of the `dpkg` command:

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                               |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `dpkg` command:

1. Install a package:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i package.deb
```

This command will install the package stored in `package.deb`. Note that dependencies may need to be resolved manually.

2. Remove a package:

```bash
sudo dpkg -r package
```

This command will remove the package named `package` from the system while keeping its configuration files.

3. Purge a package:

```bash
sudo dpkg -P package
```

This command will remove the package named `package` from the system along with its configuration files.

4. List installed packages matching a pattern:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep package_pattern
```

This command will list all installed packages whose names match `package_pattern`.

5. Show information about a package:

```bash
dpkg -s package
```

This command will display detailed information about the package named `package`.

6. List files installed by a package:

```bash
dpkg -L package
```

This command will list all the files installed by the package named `package`.

7. Search for packages matching a given file:

```bash
dpkg -S /path/to/file
```

This command will search for the package that provides the file located at `/path/to/file`.

These are just a few examples of how you can use the `dpkg` command to manage Debian packages on your system. Always use `dpkg` with caution, and be careful when removing or purging packages, as it may affect the functionality of the system if done incorrectly.
