The `more` command in Linux is used to view the contents of a text file one screenful at a time. It allows you to scroll through the file interactively, viewing the file page by page. Unlike `less`, `more` does not support backward scrolling or advanced features, making it a simple and straightforward pager for text files.

The basic syntax of the `more` command is:

```
more [options] file
```

Where:
- `file` is the name of the text file you want to view using `more`.

Here's a table showing some common options of the `more` command:

| Option        | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-d`          | Display help information (press 'h' while viewing the file).                                    |
| `+n`          | Start displaying the file from line number `n`.                                                  |
| `--help`      | Display help information for the `more` command.                                                |

Examples:

1. View the contents of a file using `more`:
   ```
   more filename.txt
   ```
   This command will open `filename.txt` in `more`, allowing you to scroll through the file using the Spacebar, Enter, and arrow keys.

2. View the file starting from a specific line number:
   ```
   more +10 large_file.log
   ```
   This command will open `large_file.log` in `more` and start displaying the content from line number 10.

3. Scroll through the file interactively:
   ```
   more document.txt
   ```
   Press the Spacebar to view the next page of the `document.txt` file.

4. Display help information while viewing the file:
   ```
   more -d long_text.txt
   ```
   While viewing `long_text.txt`, press 'h' to display help information and available commands.

5. Display help information for the `more` command:
   ```
   more --help
   ```
   This command will provide detailed information on the various options available with the `more` command.

The `more` command is a straightforward pager for viewing text files in the terminal. It is useful when you need to quickly view the content of a file, and you don't require advanced features such as backward scrolling or searching. However, for more feature-rich text file viewing, consider using the `less` command, which offers more interactive options.
