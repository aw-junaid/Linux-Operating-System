The `zless` command in Linux is used to view the contents of compressed files (usually compressed with `gzip`) in a paginated manner, allowing you to scroll through the compressed file one screen at a time. It is similar to the `less` command but designed specifically for compressed files.

The basic syntax of the `zless` command is as follows:

```
zless [options] [compressed_file]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `zless` command:

| Parameter/Option | Description                                                                                               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| compressed_file  | Specifies the name of the compressed file you want to view.                                               |
| -n, --line=N     | Start at line N in the file. By default, it starts at the beginning.                                      |
| -c, --clear-screen | Clear the screen before displaying the file.                                                             |
| -r, --raw        | Output "raw" control characters (e.g., ^C) instead of displaying them in caret notation (e.g., ^C).     |
| -S, --chop-long-lines | Do not fold long lines; display them as-is.                                                            |
| --help           | Display help and exit.                                                                                   |
| --version        | Output version information and exit.                                                                     |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `zless` command:

1. View the contents of a compressed file:

```bash
zless compressed_file.gz
```

This will display the compressed contents of `compressed_file.gz`, allowing you to scroll through the file one screen at a time.

2. Start viewing the compressed file from a specific line:

```bash
zless -n 50 compressed_file.gz
```

This will start displaying the compressed file `compressed_file.gz` from line 50.

3. Clear the screen before displaying the compressed file:

```bash
zless -c compressed_file.gz
```

This will clear the terminal screen before displaying the contents of `compressed_file.gz`.

4. View the compressed file without folding long lines:

```bash
zless -S compressed_file.gz
```

This will display the contents of `compressed_file.gz` without breaking long lines.

The `zless` command is a useful tool for reading compressed files in a paginated manner, making it convenient for inspecting large compressed logs or other data files. It allows you to view compressed data without the need to decompress it manually.
