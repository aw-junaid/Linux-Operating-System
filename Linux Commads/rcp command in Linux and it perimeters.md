The `rcp` command in Linux is used to copy files between a local host and a remote host using the rcp (remote copy) protocol. However, similar to `rlogin` and `rsh`, the rcp protocol is considered insecure because it transmits data, including file contents, in plain text. For this reason, using `rcp` is strongly discouraged in favor of more secure protocols like SCP (Secure Copy) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

Here's a table explaining some of the main parameters and options of the `rcp` command:

| Parameter | Description                                                          |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `source_file` | The path of the file on the local host that you want to copy.      |
| `username@remotehost:destination_file` | The username, remote hostname, and the path where you want to copy the file on the remote host. |

Please note that the `rcp` command should be used with extreme caution due to its lack of encryption and security. It is highly recommended to use SCP or SFTP instead, as they provide encrypted communication and secure file transfer.

Example of using `rcp`:

```bash
rcp localfile.txt username@remotehostname:/path/to/destination/
```

Replace `localfile.txt` with the path of the file you want to copy from the local host, `username` with the username on the remote host, `remotehostname` with the hostname or IP address of the remote host, and `/path/to/destination/` with the path where you want to copy the file on the remote host.

Again, it is essential to emphasize that using `rcp` is not recommended for security reasons. Instead, use SCP or SFTP for secure file transfers. If you are dealing with legacy systems that still require `rcp`, consider replacing or updating them to use more secure methods.
