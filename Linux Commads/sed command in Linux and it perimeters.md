The `sed` command in Linux is a powerful text stream editor used for text manipulation and transformation. It operates by processing input text line by line and applying specified editing commands to modify the text. The `sed` command is particularly useful for performing tasks such as search and replace, deletion, insertion, and other text transformations.

The basic syntax of the `sed` command is:

```
sed [options] 'command(s)' input_file
```

Where:
- `command(s)` represent the editing commands used to modify the input text. Multiple commands can be separated by semicolons (`;`).
- `input_file` is the file on which the `sed` commands will be applied. If not provided, `sed` reads from standard input.

Here's a table showing some common options of the `sed` command:

| Option        | Description                                                                                      |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-n`          | Suppress automatic printing of pattern space.                                                   |
| `-e`          | Add a script of editing commands to the commands to be executed.                                |
| `-i`          | Edit files in place (changes the original file).                                                |
| `--help`      | Display help information for the `sed` command.                                                 |

Examples:

1. Search and replace text in a file:
   ```
   sed 's/old_text/new_text/' input.txt
   ```
   This command will replace the first occurrence of `old_text` with `new_text` in `input.txt` and print the result to the standard output.

2. Search and replace all occurrences in a file (global substitution):
   ```
   sed 's/old_text/new_text/g' input.txt
   ```
   This command will replace all occurrences of `old_text` with `new_text` in `input.txt`.

3. Delete lines matching a specific pattern in a file:
   ```
   sed '/pattern/d' file.txt
   ```
   This command will delete all lines containing the `pattern` from `file.txt`.

4. Print only lines containing a specific pattern:
   ```
   sed -n '/pattern/p' data.txt
   ```
   This command will only print lines from `data.txt` that contain the `pattern`.

5. Append text to the end of each line in a file:
   ```
   sed 's/$/ - End of line/' content.txt
   ```
   This command will append `- End of line` to the end of each line in `content.txt`.

6. Edit files in place and create a backup file with a specific extension:
   ```
   sed -i.bak 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt
   ```
   This command will edit `file.txt` in place, making the substitution `foo` to `bar` in each occurrence. A backup of the original file will be created with the extension `.bak`.

7. Display help information for the `sed` command:
   ```
   sed --help
   ```
   This command will provide detailed information on the various options available with the `sed` command.

The `sed` command is a versatile text manipulation tool and can be used for a wide range of text processing tasks. Its compact syntax and powerful capabilities make it a fundamental tool in the Unix/Linux command-line environment.
