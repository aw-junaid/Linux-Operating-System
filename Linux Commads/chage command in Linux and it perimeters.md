The `chage` command in Linux is used to change the user password expiry information and settings. It allows you to set or modify various password-related parameters for user accounts, such as the password expiration date, the number of days before the password must be changed, and more.

Here's a table explaining some of the main parameters and options of the `chage` command:

| Parameter            | Description                                                                                                              |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -l, --list           | Display the current password expiration information for a user account.                                                 |
| -E, --expiredate     | Set the date on which the user account will expire in the format YYYY-MM-DD.                                            |
| -M, --maxdays        | Set the maximum number of days during which the password is valid.                                                      |
| -m, --mindays        | Set the minimum number of days that must pass before the password can be changed.                                       |
| -W, --warndays       | Set the number of days before password expiration to display a warning.                                                  |
| -I, --inactive       | Set the number of days after the password expires until the account is locked.                                           |
| -d, --lastday       |  Set the date on which the user account will expire in the format YYYY-MM-DD. This is an alias for --expiredate.      |
| -R, --root CHROOT_DIR | Apply changes to the CHROOT_DIR directory and not the root (/) directory.                                               |
| --help               | Display help information about the `chage` command.                                                                      |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `chage` command:

1. Display Password Expiration Information for a User:

```bash
sudo chage -l username
```

This command will display the current password expiration information for the specified user `username`.

2. Set Maximum Password Age:

```bash
sudo chage -M 90 username
```

This command will set the maximum password age to 90 days for the user `username`. After 90 days, the user will be prompted to change their password.

3. Set Minimum Password Age:

```bash
sudo chage -m 7 username
```

This command will set the minimum password age to 7 days for the user `username`. The user won't be able to change their password until at least 7 days have passed since the last password change.

4. Set Password Expiration Date:

```bash
sudo chage -E 2023-12-31 username
```

This command will set the password expiration date for the user `username` to December 31, 2023. After this date, the user's password will expire, and they will need to set a new password.

5. Set Password Expiration Warning Days:

```bash
sudo chage -W 7 username
```

This command will set the number of days before password expiration to 7 days for the user `username`. The user will receive a warning message when their password is about to expire.

6. Lock an Account:

```bash
sudo chage -E 0 username
```

This command will immediately lock the account for the user `username`. The user won't be able to log in until the account is unlocked.

These are just a few examples of how to use the `chage` command to manage password expiration settings for user accounts. Keep in mind that only privileged users (typically root or users with sudo access) can use the `chage` command to modify password-related settings for other users.
