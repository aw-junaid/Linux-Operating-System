The `tac` command in Linux is used to display the contents of a file in reverse order, line by line. It stands for "reverse cat" because it performs a similar function as the `cat` command, but in reverse. The `tac` command reads the file from the last line to the first line and prints the output accordingly.

The basic syntax of the `tac` command is as follows:

```
tac [options] [file]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `tac` command:

| Parameter/Option | Description                                              |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| file             | Specifies the name of the file to be reversed.          |
| -b, --before     | Print the separator before, instead of after, each line. |
| -r, --regex      | Interpret the separator as a regular expression.        |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `tac` command:

1. Display the contents of a file in reverse order:

```bash
tac file.txt
```

This will print the contents of `file.txt` in reverse, showing the last line first and the first line last.

2. Display the contents of a file in reverse order, with line numbers:

```bash
tac -b file.txt
```

This will print the contents of `file.txt` in reverse, and each line will be preceded by its line number.

3. Use `tac` with a regular expression separator:

```bash
tac -r 'pattern' file.txt
```

This will reverse the lines in `file.txt`, considering 'pattern' as the separator. Note that 'pattern' should be a valid regular expression.

4. Display the contents of multiple files in reverse order:

```bash
tac file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
```

This will display the contents of each file (`file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`) in reverse order, starting with the last line of each file.

The `tac` command is particularly useful when you need to view log files or analyze data where the latest information is at the end of the file.
