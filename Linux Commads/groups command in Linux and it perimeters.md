The `groups` command in Linux is used to display the groups to which a user belongs. It lists the group names that the user is a member of, including both primary and secondary (supplementary) groups.

The basic syntax of the `groups` command is as follows:

```
groups [username]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters of the `groups` command:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                            |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| username  | Optional. Specifies the username of the user for whom you want to see the group membership.           |
| --help    | Display help and exit.                                                                                |
| --version | Output version information and exit.                                                                  |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `groups` command:

1. Display the groups for the current user:

```bash
groups
```

This will show the group membership for the currently logged-in user.

2. Display the groups for a specific user:

```bash
groups john
```

Replace `john` with the username of the user whose group membership you want to see.

3. Display the groups for a different user (requires superuser privileges):

```bash
sudo groups alice
```

This will show the group membership for the user `alice`. The `sudo` command is used to execute `groups` with superuser (root) privileges, as accessing another user's group information may require elevated permissions.

The `groups` command is useful for quickly checking the group membership of a user. It can be handy for system administrators to verify a user's group associations and to ensure proper access control to files and resources based on group permissions.
