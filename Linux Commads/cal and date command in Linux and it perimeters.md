The `cal` and `date` commands in Linux are used to display calendar and date-related information in the terminal.

1. `cal` command:

The `cal` command is used to display the calendar for a specific month or year.

The basic syntax of the `cal` command is as follows:

```
cal [options] [month] [year]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `cal` command:

| Parameter/Option | Description                                                                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| month            | Specifies the month (1 to 12) for which you want to display the calendar. If omitted, it shows the current month. |
| year             | Specifies the year for which you want to display the calendar. If omitted, it shows the current year.          |
| -3               | Display the previous, current, and next month's calendars side by side.                                       |
| -j               | Display the day of the year (Julian day) in addition to the regular calendar.                                  |
| -y               | Display a calendar for the whole year.                                                                        |
| --help           | Display help and exit.                                                                                        |
| --version        | Output version information and exit.                                                                          |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `cal` command:

```bash
cal
```

This will display the calendar for the current month.

```bash
cal 7 2023
```

This will display the calendar for July 2023.

```bash
cal -3
```

This will display the calendars for the previous, current, and next months side by side.

```bash
cal -y
```

This will display the calendar for the whole current year.

2. `date` command:

The `date` command is used to display the current date and time.

The basic syntax of the `date` command is as follows:

```
date [options]
```

Here's a table explaining the main parameters and options of the `date` command:

| Parameter/Option | Description                                                                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -R, --rfc-2822   | Output date and time in RFC 2822 format.                                                                     |
| -u, --utc, --universal | Output date and time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) instead of the local timezone.                 |
| --help           | Display help and exit.                                                                                        |
| --version        | Output version information and exit.                                                                          |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `date` command:

```bash
date
```

This will display the current date and time in the local timezone.

```bash
date -R
```

This will display the current date and time in RFC 2822 format.

```bash
date -u
```

This will display the current date and time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

The `cal` and `date` commands are simple but useful utilities for getting calendar and date-related information on the Linux command line. They can be helpful for planning and scheduling tasks or for displaying time-sensitive information in scripts and terminal sessions.
