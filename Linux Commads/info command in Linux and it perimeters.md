In Linux, the `info` command is used to access the documentation or manual pages in the Info format. Info is a more structured and hyperlinked documentation system compared to traditional plain text manual pages. It is commonly used for GNU software and provides a hierarchical and interconnected way to browse and explore documentation.

The basic syntax of the `info` command is:

```
info [option] <command_or_topic>
```

Here is a table outlining the parameters of the `info` command:

| Parameter           | Description                                        |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `<command_or_topic>`| Specifies the name of a command or a specific topic in the Info documentation. If a command is provided, it will display the relevant documentation for that command. If a topic is provided, it will display the corresponding Info page related to that topic.|
| `[option]`          | Optional. Specifies additional options to customize the behavior of the `info` command. Common options include `-h` (display help) and `-f` (force reformatting the output).|

Examples:

1. Display documentation for the `ls` command:
```
info ls
```

2. Access the Info page for the C programming language:
```
info C
```

3. Show the Info documentation for the `tar` command:
```
info tar
```

4. View the complete Info manual for the GNU core utilities:
```
info coreutils
```

5. Get help on using the `info` command itself:
```
info -h
```

6. Force the reformatting of the output for the `grep` command:
```
info -f grep
```

Note: The availability of `info` documentation depends on whether the particular package provides Info pages. Not all software packages use the Info format, so the `info` command might not work for all commands or topics. In such cases, you can resort to using `man` pages (`man` command) or online documentation for the respective software.
