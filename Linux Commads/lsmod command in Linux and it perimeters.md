The `lsmod` command in Linux is used to list all currently loaded kernel modules in the running kernel. Kernel modules are small pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded or unloaded into the kernel to add or extend its functionality without the need to reboot the system. The `lsmod` command provides a quick overview of the modules that are currently in use.

The basic syntax of the `lsmod` command is as follows:

```
lsmod
```

Here's a table explaining the output columns of the `lsmod` command:

| Column Header | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Module        | The name of the loaded kernel module.                                                                        |
| Size          | The size of the kernel module in bytes.                                                                      |
| Used by       | Lists the other modules or components that are currently using the module.                                   |

Now, let's see an example of how to use the `lsmod` command:

```bash
lsmod
```

Sample output:
```
Module                 Size   Used by
nls_utf8               16384  1
isofs                  49152  1
usb_storage            81920  1
uas                    24576  0
sd_mod                 61440  5
```

In this example, the `lsmod` command lists the loaded kernel modules along with their sizes and the modules or components that are currently using them.

The `lsmod` command is useful for inspecting which kernel modules are currently loaded and to identify dependencies between modules. It provides valuable information for troubleshooting and managing the kernel modules on a Linux system.
