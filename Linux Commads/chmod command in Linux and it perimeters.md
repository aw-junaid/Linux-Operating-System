The `chmod` command in Linux is used to change the permissions (read, write, execute) of files and directories. It allows you to set or modify the access permissions for the owner, group, and others. The permissions can be represented using a three-digit octal number or a symbolic notation.

In symbolic notation, the format of the `chmod` command is:

```
chmod who_operator_permissions filename
```

Where:
- `who` specifies the users or groups whose permissions are being modified: 
  - `u`: User/owner
  - `g`: Group
  - `o`: Others (everyone else)
  - `a`: All (equivalent to `ugo`)
- `operator` is one of the following:
  - `+`: Add permission
  - `-`: Remove permission
  - `=`: Set permission
- `permissions` are the letters representing the permissions:
  - `r`: Read
  - `w`: Write
  - `x`: Execute

You can also combine multiple permissions together in the `permissions` section. For example, `rw` means both read and write permissions, and `rwx` means read, write, and execute permissions.

Here's a table showing some examples of `chmod` commands:

| Command                | Description                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chmod u+x file.txt`   | Adds execute permission for the owner to the file.txt          |
| `chmod go-rw file.txt` | Removes read and write permissions from the group and others   |
| `chmod a=r file.txt`   | Sets read-only permission for all (owner, group, and others)   |
| `chmod u=rw,g=rx,o= file.txt` | Sets read and write for the owner, read and execute for the group, and no permissions for others |
| `chmod 755 script.sh`  | Sets read, write, and execute for the owner and read/execute for group and others (commonly used for executable scripts) |
| `chmod -R 644 folder/` | Recursively sets read and write for the owner and read-only for group and others for all files in the folder |

In the last example, the `-R` option is used to recursively apply the permissions to all files and directories within the specified folder.

Remember that using `chmod` with incorrect permissions can lead to security issues, so exercise caution when modifying permissions on important files and directories. Always understand the implications of changing permissions before applying them.
