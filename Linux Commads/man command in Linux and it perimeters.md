In Linux, the `man` command is used to display the manual pages for commands, system calls, and other topics. It provides detailed information and usage instructions for various commands and functionalities available on the system.

The basic syntax of the `man` command is:

```
man [section] <command_or_topic>
```

Here is a table outlining the parameters of the `man` command:

| Parameter            | Description                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `[section]`          | Optional. Specifies the section number of the manual to search for the command or topic. Each section corresponds to a specific type of information, such as commands (section 1), system calls (section 2), library calls (section 3), and so on. If not specified, `man` will start from section 1 and display the first match found. You can use the section number followed by the command or topic to specifically select the desired manual section.|
| `<command_or_topic>` | Specifies the name of a command or a specific topic for which you want to access the manual page.|

Examples:

1. Display the manual page for the `ls` command:
```
man ls
```

2. Access the manual page for the `fork` system call (Section 2):
```
man 2 fork
```

3. Show the manual page for the `printf` C library function (Section 3):
```
man 3 printf
```

4. View the manual page for the `crontab` command:
```
man crontab
```

5. Get help on using the `man` command itself:
```
man man
```

6. Display the manual page for the `sshd_config` configuration file (Section 5):
```
man 5 sshd_config
```

In Linux, the `man` command is an invaluable tool for quickly accessing detailed information about various commands and system components. It is essential for understanding how to use specific commands and their options effectively.
