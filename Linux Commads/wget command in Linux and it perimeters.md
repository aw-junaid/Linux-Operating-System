The `wget` command in Linux is a powerful tool for downloading files from the internet. It supports various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. With `wget`, you can download single files or recursively mirror entire websites. Here's a table explaining some of the main parameters and options of the `wget` command:

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -q, --quiet    | Quiet mode. Suppresses output except for error messages.                                           |
| -P, --directory-prefix=<prefix> | Save files to the specified directory.                                                        |
| -r, --recursive| Download files recursively.                                                                       |
| -np, --no-parent | Do not ascend to the parent directory when using recursive mode.                                 |
| -N, --timestamping | Only download files that are newer than what is already on the local filesystem.               |
| -c, --continue | Continue interrupted downloads.                                                                  |
| -b, --background | Go to the background immediately after startup.                                                |
| -o, --output-file=<file> | Write output to a specified file.                                                               |
| -O, --output-document=<file> | Write output to a specified file, preserving remote filename.                                 |
| --limit-rate=<rate> | Limit the download rate to a specified value (e.g., 1M for 1 megabyte per second).             |
| --user=<username> | Set the username for authentication (used with HTTP and FTP).                                    |
| --password=<password> | Set the password for authentication (used with HTTP and FTP).                                  |
| --no-check-certificate | Do not check SSL certificates. Use with caution, as it may compromise security.                |

Now, let's see some examples of how to use the `wget` command:

1. Download a Single File:

```bash
wget https://example.com/file.txt
```

This command will download the file `file.txt` from the specified URL.

2. Download a File and Save with a Different Name:

```bash
wget -O output_file.txt https://example.com/file.txt
```

This command will download `file.txt` from the URL and save it as `output_file.txt`.

3. Download Files Recursively:

```bash
wget -r https://example.com/directory/
```

This command will recursively download all files and directories from `https://example.com/directory/`.

4. Limit Download Speed:

```bash
wget --limit-rate=1M https://example.com/large_file.zip
```

This command will download `large_file.zip` from the URL but limit the download speed to 1 megabyte per second.

5. Download with Authentication:

```bash
wget --user=username --password=password https://example.com/secure_file.zip
```

This command will download `secure_file.zip` from the URL, using the specified username and password for authentication (if required).

6. Download and Continue an Interrupted Download:

```bash
wget -c https://example.com/large_file.zip
```

This command will resume a previously interrupted download of `large_file.zip`.

7. Save Files to a Specific Directory:

```bash
wget -P /path/to/directory/ https://example.com/files/*
```

This command will download all files from `https://example.com/files/` and save them in `/path/to/directory/`.

Please note that using `wget` to download files from the internet should be done responsibly and only for legal and ethical purposes. Be mindful of copyright laws and usage restrictions when downloading files. Additionally, consider the security implications of using the `--no-check-certificate` option and only use it when necessary and in trusted environments.
