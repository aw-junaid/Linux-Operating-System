The `pwd` command in Linux is used to print the current working directory. It displays the absolute path of the directory you are currently in within the file system.

The basic syntax of the `pwd` command is:

```
pwd
```

Here's a table with information about the `pwd` command:

| Command   | Description                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `pwd`     | Prints the absolute path of the current directory.|

Examples:

1. Display the current working directory:
   ```
   pwd
   ```
   This command will output the absolute path of the current directory, for example: `/home/user/documents`.

2. Use `pwd` with backticks (`` ` ``) to capture the output in a shell variable:
   ```
   current_dir=`pwd`
   echo "Current directory: $current_dir"
   ```
   This command stores the output of `pwd` (the current directory path) in the `current_dir` variable and then prints it.

3. Use `pwd` with a subshell to execute commands within a specific directory:
   ```
   (cd /path/to/directory && echo "In this subshell, the current directory is: $(pwd)")
   ```
   This command temporarily changes the directory to `/path/to/directory` in a subshell, executes a command (in this case, echoing the current directory), and then returns to the original directory.

The `pwd` command is helpful when you need to confirm the absolute path of your current location in the file system. It is often used in shell scripts or when navigating between directories in the terminal.
