The `lpr` command in Linux is used to print files on a printer connected to the system. It sends the specified file(s) to the printing queue, allowing them to be printed using the default or specified printer. The `lpr` command is commonly used for printing text files, documents, and images from the command line.

The basic syntax of the `lpr` command is:

```
lpr [options] file1 file2 ... fileN
```

Where:
- `file1 file2 ... fileN` represents one or more files you want to print.

Here's a table showing some common options of the `lpr` command:

Examples:

1. Print a single file using the default printer:
   ```
   lpr document.txt
   ```
   This command sends the `document.txt` file to the default printer for printing.

2. Print multiple files and specify the number of copies:
   ```
   lpr -# 3 file1.txt file2.txt
   ```
   This command prints `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, each with three copies.

3. Print a file using a specific printer:
   ```
   lpr -P printer_name image.jpg
   ```
   This command sends `image.jpg` to the printer with the name `printer_name` for printing.

4. Set a title for the print job:
   ```
   lpr -C "Confidential Document" report.doc
   ```
   This command sets the title "Confidential Document" for the print job of `report.doc`.

5. Set specific printer options:
   ```
   lpr -o fit-to-page=true -o page-set=odd manuscript.pdf
   ```
   This command sets the options "fit-to-page=true" and "page-set=odd" for printing `manuscript.pdf`.

6. Suppress print queue messages:
   ```
   lpr -q file.txt
   ```
   This command prints `file.txt` without displaying print queue messages.

7. Display help information for the `lpr` command:
   ```
   lpr --help
   ```
   This command will provide detailed information on the various options available with the `lpr` command.

Keep in mind that the availability of specific options may vary depending on the printer and the printing system used in your Linux distribution. Additionally, you may need appropriate permissions to use the `lpr` command and access the printers on the system.
