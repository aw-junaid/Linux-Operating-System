Incremental backups in Linux allow you to back up only the data that has changed since the last backup, thereby reducing the backup time and storage requirements. The `rsync` command is commonly used for incremental backups in Linux. It efficiently synchronizes files and directories between the source and destination while preserving permissions, timestamps, and ownership.

Here's how you can perform incremental backups using the `rsync` command:

1. Initial Full Backup:
Perform an initial full backup to create a baseline of the data. This full backup will include all the files and directories you want to back up.

```bash
rsync -av /path/to/source/ /path/to/destination/
```

In this command:
- `-a`: Archive mode, which preserves permissions, timestamps, and ownership of files.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, which displays the progress of the backup process.
- `/path/to/source/`: The source directory you want to back up.
- `/path/to/destination/`: The destination directory where the backup will be stored.

2. Perform Incremental Backups:
After the initial full backup, you can perform incremental backups by using the `--link-dest` option with `rsync`. This option creates hard links for unchanged files from the previous backup to the new backup, saving disk space by avoiding duplication.

```bash
rsync -av --link-dest=/path/to/previous_backup/ /path/to/source/ /path/to/new_backup/
```

In this command:
- `--link-dest=/path/to/previous_backup/`: Specifies the path to the previous backup directory. This tells `rsync` to create hard links for unchanged files in the new backup, linking them to the corresponding files in the previous backup. This option ensures that only changed files are physically copied to the new backup, saving space and time.

3. Rotate Backups (Optional):
To maintain a retention policy for backups, you can use a script to rotate and delete older backups, keeping only a certain number of incremental backups. This helps manage disk space and ensures you have multiple backups with different timestamps.

Here's an example script to rotate backups:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the source and destination directories
SOURCE_DIR="/path/to/source/"
DEST_DIR="/path/to/backups/"

# Perform the incremental backup
rsync -av --link-dest="$DEST_DIR/backup-1" "$SOURCE_DIR" "$DEST_DIR/backup-2"

# Delete the oldest backup if you want to retain only a certain number of backups
if [ -d "$DEST_DIR/backup-3" ]; then
    rm -rf "$DEST_DIR/backup-3"
fi

# Rename the previous backups to create a rolling backup set
mv "$DEST_DIR/backup-2" "$DEST_DIR/backup-3"
mv "$DEST_DIR/backup-1" "$DEST_DIR/backup-2"
mv "$DEST_DIR/backup-2" "$DEST_DIR/backup-1"
```

In this script, the `rsync` command performs the incremental backup, and the older backups are rotated using a rolling naming convention (backup-1, backup-2, backup-3, etc.).

Please note that incremental backups with `rsync` are efficient for syncing files and directories between systems, but it is not a backup solution in itself. For a comprehensive backup strategy, consider combining incremental backups with other techniques, such as regular full backups, off-site backups, and version control systems. Additionally, it's essential to test and verify the backup and restore processes to ensure data integrity and availability when needed.
