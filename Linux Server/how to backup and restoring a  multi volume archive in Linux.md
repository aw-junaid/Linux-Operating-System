To create a multi-volume archive in Linux, you can use the `tar` command with the `--multi-volume` option along with the `--tape-length` option to specify the size of each volume. This allows you to split a large archive into multiple smaller files, making it easier to store and transfer across different storage media. To restore the multi-volume archive, you only need to extract the files from the first volume, and `tar` will automatically continue reading the subsequent volumes if they are available in the same directory.

Here's how you can create a multi-volume archive:

1. Backup as Multi-Volume Archive:

```bash
tar --multi-volume --tape-length=<size> -cvf backup.tar /path/to/directory
```

In this command:
- `--multi-volume`: Enables multi-volume mode.
- `--tape-length=<size>`: Specifies the size of each volume. Replace `<size>` with the desired size, such as `10M` for 10 megabytes or `1G` for 1 gigabyte.
- `-c`: Create a new archive.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, which will display the progress of the backup process.
- `-f`: Specify the name of the output archive file (`backup.tar` in this case).
- `/path/to/directory`: The directory you want to back up.

`tar` will create multiple archive files with the specified size, named `backup.tar`, `backup.tar.2`, `backup.tar.3`, and so on, if the data in the specified directory exceeds the given size limit.

2. Restoring from Multi-Volume Archive:

To restore from the multi-volume archive, you only need to extract files from the first volume, and `tar` will automatically continue reading the subsequent volumes if they are present in the same directory:

```bash
tar -xvf backup.tar -C /path/to/destination
```

In this command:
- `-x`: Extract files from the archive.
- `-v`: Verbose mode, which will display the progress of the extraction process.
- `-f`: Specify the name of the input archive file (`backup.tar` in this case).
- `-C`: Specify the destination directory where the contents of the archive will be extracted.

`tar` will automatically detect and extract from all the volumes in the sequence, starting with `backup.tar`, `backup.tar.2`, `backup.tar.3`, and so on, until all the data is restored to the destination directory.

Please ensure that you have enough free space in the destination directory to accommodate the extracted data from the multi-volume archive. Additionally, make sure that all the volumes of the archive are present in the same directory before attempting to restore the data.
