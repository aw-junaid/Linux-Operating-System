To turn off standalone services in Linux, you typically use the service management tool specific to your Linux distribution. Common service management tools include `systemctl` (used in systemd-based distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Fedora) and `service` (used in older SysV init-based distributions like Debian).

Here are the general steps to turn off a standalone service:

1. Identify the Service Name:
Find the name of the service you want to turn off. You can usually find this in the service configuration files or by running a command like `systemctl list-units` or `service --status-all`.

2. Stop the Service:
Use the appropriate command to stop the service:

For systemd-based systems (using systemctl):
```bash
sudo systemctl stop service_name
```

For SysV init-based systems (using service):
```bash
sudo service service_name stop
```

3. Disable the Service (Optional):
If you want to prevent the service from starting automatically during system boot, you can disable it:

For systemd-based systems (using systemctl):
```bash
sudo systemctl disable service_name
```

For SysV init-based systems (using update-rc.d):
```bash
sudo update-rc.d service_name disable
```

Please note that the specific commands may vary slightly depending on your Linux distribution. Also, the steps above assume that you have sufficient privileges (usually sudo or root access) to stop and disable services.

If you are unsure about the service management tool or the exact service name, you can refer to your distribution's documentation or use online resources to find the appropriate commands for your specific Linux distribution.

As a general caution, be careful when turning off services, especially critical ones, as it can affect the system's functionality. Make sure you understand the consequences of stopping or disabling a service before proceeding.
