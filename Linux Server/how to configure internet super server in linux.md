In Linux, the "Internet Super Server" usually refers to a process called `inetd` (or `xinetd` in some distributions), which acts as a super server for various internet services. The primary purpose of `inetd` is to manage and spawn specific network services only when a client requests them, reducing resource usage and increasing security.

Here's how to configure `inetd` or `xinetd` on Linux:

1. Install `inetd` or `xinetd`:
First, ensure that `inetd` or `xinetd` is installed on your system. Some Linux distributions come with `xinetd` installed by default, while others may use `inetd`. To install `xinetd`, you can use the package manager of your distribution:

For `xinetd` on Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install xinetd
```

For `xinetd` on CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
sudo yum install xinetd
```

2. Enable and Start the Service:
After installation, enable and start the `xinetd` service:

For `xinetd` on systemd-based systems:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable xinetd
sudo systemctl start xinetd
```

3. Configure Services:
The configuration file for `xinetd` is usually located at `/etc/xinetd.conf`. However, many distributions use a modular approach, where individual service configurations are stored in separate files under the `/etc/xinetd.d/` directory.

Each service configuration file defines how `xinetd` will handle a specific service. You can create or edit the configuration files as needed. Each configuration file has a similar structure, including settings like the service name, port number, and the command to execute when a client requests the service.

Here's a basic example of configuring `xinetd` to handle the `echo` service:

Create or edit the configuration file `/etc/xinetd.d/echo` with the following content:

```plaintext
service echo
{
    socket_type = stream
    protocol = tcp
    wait = no
    user = nobody
    server = /usr/bin/echo
    log_on_success += DURATION
    log_on_failure += HOST
}
```

4. Reload `xinetd` Configuration:
After making changes to the `xinetd` configuration, you need to reload the configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload xinetd
```

The changes should now take effect, and `xinetd` will manage the services as specified in the configuration files.

Please note that modern Linux distributions often use other service managers like systemd for managing network services. In such cases, the use of `xinetd` may be limited, and the configuration method may differ. It's essential to understand the specific service management system used by your distribution to ensure correct configuration and management of internet services.
