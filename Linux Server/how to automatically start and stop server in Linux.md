To automatically start and stop a server in Linux, you need to configure it as a service and then enable or disable the service to start or stop automatically during the system boot process. The process for setting up automatic startup and shutdown can vary depending on your Linux distribution and the init system being used (systemd, SysVinit, Upstart, etc.). Below, I'll provide a general guide for setting up automatic startup and shutdown using systemd and SysVinit:

**1. Systemd:**
   - Create a systemd unit file for your server service. Unit files are typically stored in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory with the `.service` extension. For example, if you have a server named "myserver," you can create a unit file called `myserver.service`.

   - Open the unit file in a text editor and define the service details, such as the service name, description, command to start the server, and any dependencies. Here's an example of a simple `myserver.service` unit file:

     ```
     [Unit]
     Description=My Server Service
     After=network.target

     [Service]
     Type=simple
     ExecStart=/path/to/your/server/start_command

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```

   - Save the unit file and reload systemd to apply the changes:
     ```
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     ```

   - To enable the service to start automatically during boot:
     ```
     sudo systemctl enable myserver.service
     ```

   - To disable the service from starting automatically during boot:
     ```
     sudo systemctl disable myserver.service
     ```

   - To start the service immediately:
     ```
     sudo systemctl start myserver.service
     ```

   - To stop the service:
     ```
     sudo systemctl stop myserver.service
     ```

**2. SysVinit:**
   - In SysVinit, you typically create a startup script (also called init script) for your server service and place it in the `/etc/init.d/` directory. The script should have appropriate start and stop functions defined.

   - Ensure the script has executable permissions:
     ```
     sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/myserver
     ```

   - To enable the service to start automatically during boot:
     ```
     sudo update-rc.d myserver defaults
     ```

   - To disable the service from starting automatically during boot:
     ```
     sudo update-rc.d -f myserver remove
     ```

   - To start the service immediately:
     ```
     sudo service myserver start
     ```

   - To stop the service:
     ```
     sudo service myserver stop
     ```

Again, remember to adjust the service name and commands to match your specific server. It's important to use the correct commands for the init system in your Linux distribution, as different distributions may use different init systems by default.
