To download and unpack software in Linux, you can use various methods and tools depending on the distribution and the package format. Here are common methods for downloading and unpacking software in Linux:

1. Using Package Manager:
Most Linux distributions come with a package manager that allows you to download and install software from official repositories. Examples include `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, `dnf` for Fedora, `yum` for CentOS/RHEL, and `pacman` for Arch Linux. To install software using the package manager, you can use commands like:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo apt update
sudo apt install package_name

# For Fedora
sudo dnf install package_name

# For CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install package_name

# For Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S package_name
```

2. Downloading Source Code and Compiling:
For some software not available in the official repositories, you may need to download the source code and compile it manually. This method involves more steps and may require dependencies to be installed. Here's a general outline:

```bash
# Download the source code archive (e.g., .tar.gz or .zip)
wget https://example.com/software.tar.gz

# Unpack the archive
tar -xzvf software.tar.gz

# Navigate to the extracted directory
cd software/

# Read the installation instructions (usually found in a README or INSTALL file)
cat README

# Configure, compile, and install the software
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

3. Downloading Binary Packages:
Some software may offer pre-compiled binary packages in various formats like `.deb`, `.rpm`, or `.tar.gz`. You can download these packages and install them using package managers or extract them manually using `tar`.

```bash
# Download the binary package
wget https://example.com/software.deb

# Install using package manager (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install ./software.deb

# Extract manually (tar.gz example)
tar -xzvf software.tar.gz
```

4. Using Package Managers with Non-Official Repositories:
Some software may be available in third-party repositories or software centers. You can add these repositories to your package manager and then install software from them.

For example, on Ubuntu, you can add a PPA (Personal Package Archive) and install software from there:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:example/repository
sudo apt update
sudo apt install package_name
```

Remember to use `sudo` when necessary to gain administrative privileges for installation or extraction. Also, ensure that you are downloading software from trusted sources to avoid security risks.

Keep in mind that the exact commands and methods may vary based on the Linux distribution you are using. Always refer to the official documentation or community resources for the specific distribution to get the most accurate instructions for downloading and installing software.
