The Linux Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) ensures fairness in CPU allocation by treating all processes as if they were running on their own dedicated processor. The primary goal of CFS is to distribute CPU time among competing processes in a fair and efficient manner. Here's how Linux CFS achieves fairness:

1. **Virtual Runtime Calculation:**
   - CFS calculates the virtual runtime for each process, representing the time the process has spent executing on the CPU. The virtual runtime is continuously updated based on the actual runtime of the process and its assigned weight.

2. **Weighted Fair Queuing:**
   - CFS uses a concept called "weighted fair queuing" to determine the length of time slices (quantum) allocated to each process. Each process is assigned a weight, and the scheduler adjusts the length of its time slice based on this weight. Heavier-weighted processes receive longer time slices, while lighter-weighted processes receive shorter ones.

3. **Red-Black Tree Data Structure:**
   - CFS maintains a red-black tree data structure to organize processes in a scheduling timeline. The tree structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of processes based on their virtual runtimes. Processes with smaller virtual runtimes are closer to the root of the tree and are given priority for execution.

4. **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:**
   - CFS dynamically adjusts the priorities of processes based on their behavior. Processes that use less than their entitled share of CPU time are given higher priority, while processes that use more than their entitlement are given lower priority. This dynamic adjustment helps in adapting to varying workloads and ensures that processes are treated fairly over time.

5. **Stable O(1) Complexity:**
   - CFS is designed to have a stable time complexity, specifically O(1), with respect to the number of processes. This means that the performance of the scheduler remains relatively constant as the number of processes in the system increases. The red-black tree data structure contributes to this efficiency.

6. **No Priority Inversion:**
   - CFS minimizes priority inversion by considering the waiting time of a process. If a process has been waiting for a long time, it is given higher priority, even if its virtual runtime is relatively small. This prevents situations where a process has been waiting for a significant amount of time but is continuously preempted by processes with smaller virtual runtimes.

7. **Balancing the Tree:**
   - CFS employs mechanisms to balance the red-black tree, ensuring that the scheduling timeline remains balanced and that processes with similar virtual runtimes are treated fairly. Balancing the tree helps maintain efficiency in selecting the next process to run.

8. **Real-Time Task Integration:**
   - CFS allows the integration of real-time tasks into its scheduling framework. While maintaining fairness, CFS adjusts the priorities of real-time tasks to ensure timely execution. This integration enables a balance between fairness and the responsiveness required by real-time tasks.

By incorporating these principles and mechanisms, Linux CFS provides a fair and efficient CPU scheduling algorithm that adapts to varying workloads and ensures that processes receive a reasonable share of CPU time based on their weights and behaviors.
