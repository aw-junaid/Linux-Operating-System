**Here's how the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) in Linux handles processes with different nice values:**

**1. Nice Values as Weights:**
   - CFS translates nice values (-20 to 19) into weights using a formula that roughly equates to:
      ```
      weight = 1024 / (1.25 ^ nice_value)
      ```
   - Higher nice values (lower priorities) result in smaller weights, while lower nice values (higher priorities) result in larger weights.

**2. Impact on Virtual Runtime (vruntime):**
   - When a process with a specific weight receives CPU time, its vruntime advances at a rate proportional to its weight.
   - This means that processes with lower weights (higher nice values) accumulate vruntime more slowly, effectively giving them a lower priority in scheduling decisions.

**3. Scheduling Decisions:**
   - CFS always selects the process with the lowest vruntime to run next.
   - Due to the slower vruntime accumulation of processes with higher nice values, they are less likely to have the lowest vruntime and thus less likely to be scheduled as frequently.
   - This results in them receiving less CPU time overall, as intended by the nice value system.

**4. Proportional Fairness:**
   - CFS maintains a balance of fairness among processes with different weights by ensuring that the ratio of vruntime between any two processes remains proportional to their weights.
   - This means that even processes with lower weights (higher nice values) will eventually get a chance to run, but at a slower rate than those with higher priorities.

**5. Red-Black Tree Organization:**
   - The red-black tree structure used by CFS efficiently organizes processes based on their vruntime, taking into account their weights.
   - This allows for quick identification of the process with the lowest weighted vruntime for scheduling.

**6. Dynamic Priority Adjustments:**
   - CFS might temporarily boost the priority of interactive or I/O-bound processes to improve responsiveness.
   - This can override nice values for short periods to ensure a smooth user experience.

**7. User Control:**
   - Users can adjust nice values using tools like `nice` and `renice` to influence process priorities and resource allocation.

**In summary, CFS integrates nice values into its scheduling decisions by adjusting vruntime accumulation rates based on process weights. This allows for varying levels of CPU prioritization while maintaining overall fairness and responsiveness in the system.**
