Linux boots through a series of stages that involve the BIOS/UEFI, boot loader, kernel, and the init process. Let's go through each stage:

1. **BIOS/UEFI:**
   - When you power on your computer, the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is the first piece of software that runs. It performs hardware checks and loads the boot loader.

2. **Boot Loader (GRUB, LILO, etc.):**
   - The boot loader is responsible for loading the Linux kernel into memory. One of the most common boot loaders used in Linux systems is GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader). It presents a boot menu (if configured) and then loads the selected kernel into memory.

3. **Kernel:**
   - Once the kernel is loaded into memory, it is decompressed and initialized. The kernel is the core of the operating system, and it is responsible for managing hardware, memory, and processes.

4. **Init Process:**
   - After the kernel is loaded, the init process is the first user-space process to start. It has process ID (PID) 1 and is the ancestor of all other processes in the system.
   - The init process is responsible for bringing up the rest of the user-space and starting all essential system services. It reads the configuration file `/etc/inittab` (or `/etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf` on some systems) to determine the default run level.

5. **Run Levels:**
   - In traditional SysVinit systems (older Linux distributions), run levels are used to define the system's operational state. Each run level corresponds to a different set of services and daemons that are started or stopped. The run levels are defined in the `/etc/inittab` file.
   - The common run levels are:
      - Run Level 0: Halt the system (shutdown).
      - Run Level 1: Single-user mode, used for system maintenance tasks.
      - Run Level 2: Multi-user mode without networking.
      - Run Level 3: Multi-user mode with networking.
      - Run Level 4: Not used by default, can be customized by the user.
      - Run Level 5: Multi-user mode with networking and GUI (X Window System).
      - Run Level 6: Reboot the system.

6. **Systemd and Modern Init Systems:**
   - Modern Linux distributions have adopted systemd as the default init system. Systemd replaces the traditional SysVinit and introduces a new way of managing services and booting the system.
   - In systemd, run levels are replaced by "targets," and the most commonly used target is `multi-user.target`, which is similar to the traditional Run Level 3. The `graphical.target` is equivalent to Run Level 5.

In summary, Linux boots through the BIOS/UEFI, boot loader, and kernel, and then the init process (or systemd) is responsible for starting all other necessary user-space processes and services based on the configured run level (or target).
