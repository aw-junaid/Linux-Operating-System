To access system information via the `/proc` file system, you can read the content of various files located in the `/proc` directory. Each file provides specific system-related data. Here's a table with some common system information and the corresponding files in the `/proc` file system:

| System Information           | File in /proc                                  | Description                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| System Uptime                | `/proc/uptime`                                  | System uptime in seconds since the last boot.                                                          |
| Mounted File Systems         | `/proc/mounts`                                  | List of currently mounted file systems and their mount points.                                        |
| Process Information          | `/proc/[pid]/status`                            | Detailed information about a specific process with process ID `[pid]`.                                |
| Kernel Parameters            | `/proc/sys`                                    | Various kernel parameters and configurations.                                                          |
| Kernel Version               | `/proc/version`                                 | Information about the Linux kernel version.                                                            |
| Interrupts Information       | `/proc/interrupts`                             | Details about CPU interrupts, including the number of interrupts per CPU.                             |
| File Descriptor Information  | `/proc/[pid]/fd`                                | List of file descriptors associated with a specific process with process ID `[pid]`.                 |
| Load Average                 | `/proc/loadavg`                                | System load average over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.                                                |
| Interrupts Information       | `/proc/interrupts`                             | Details about CPU interrupts, including the number of interrupts per CPU.                             |
| CPU Scheduling Information   | `/proc/sched_debug` (Linux 4.16+)               | Information about the CPU scheduling, including task priority and scheduling decisions.                |

You can access the information by using commands like `cat`, `grep`, or `less`. For example:

```bash
cat /proc/cpuinfo    # Display CPU information
cat /proc/meminfo    # Display memory information
cat /proc/net/dev    # Display network interface statistics
cat /proc/uptime     # Display system uptime
```

Please note that the availability and format of some files may vary based on the Linux distribution and kernel version you are using. Always be cautious when modifying or interpreting kernel-related files as incorrect changes may affect system stability and performance.
